Denovo Symmetry Definition File

*OPTIONS*

-   (Point AKA NCS AKA noncrystallographic default) symmetry type:
    cyclic or dihedral

    -   Alternatively, helical (rotation & transition along one symmetry
        axis), or wallpaper & crystal (subunit forms repeating 2D or
        3D pattern)

    -   Expect 3-6 DoF, where dofs are torsion angles of the backbone
        and side-chains along with the rigid-body transformations
        between peptide segments, only with regards to the master
        subunit (surrounded by all interaction partners needed to
        calculate total energy)

        -   Jumps control the position of each subunit relative to its
            reference frame (wrt rigid body symmetry)

            -   Reference frame coordinates (AKA virtual
                residue coordinates) can be set manually through X & Y
                axis unit vectors (start & stop) or rotation &
                translation of a single virtual residue

        -   3 rotational, 3 translational variables describe the
            rigid-body transformation between start and end coordinates
            of the jump, then further restricted by axes

-   Number of subunits

-   Simulate subsystem

-   Slide\_type

    -   How multidimensional slide should be performed: randomly for
        each step, random for first step but sequential through both, or
        order manually

-   Slide\_criteria\_type

    -   Abandon slide if: (don’t understand options other than number
        of contacts)

-   Slide\_criteria\_val (use if type is CONTACTS)

    -   Value when a slide move is abandoned, given criteria

        -   In principle, a protein complex with identical symmetry can
            be used as the starting point to generate a SDF using
            the *make\_symmdef\_file.pl* script. The resulting SDF has
            to be modified by hand to remove any dependence on the rigid
            body position of the analyzed complex and to completely
            randomize the symmetric rigid body space. 

*Example Symmdef File Denovo from DiMaio article:*

symmetry\_name c2

subunits 2

recenter

number of interfaces 1

E = 2\*VRT0001 + 1\*(VRT0001:VRT0002)

-   subunit connected to virtual residue 0001 is the scoring subunit,
    with internal energies multiplied by 2 to get total system energy,
    with intermolecular energies from subunits connected to VRT0002
    added with a factor of 1)

anchor residue COM

virtual transforms start

start -1,0,0 0,1,0 0,0,0

rot Rz 2

virtual transforms stop

connect virtual JUMP1 VRT0001 VRT0002

set\_dof BASEJUMP x(50) anglex(0:360) angle\_y(0:360)

angle\_z(0:360)

-   A 2^nd^ virtual residue is generated by application of twofold
    rotation around the Cartesian Z axis

-   For the jump BASEJUMP, translation along x axis initialized at value
    of 50 and rotation around x, y, and z axes allowed

    -   Two subunits at (50, 0, 0) and (-50, 0, 0) for non-contact

    -   All angles 0-360 degree, so random & uniformly sampled

-   make\_symmdef\_file\_denovo.py -symm\_type cn -nsub 2 &gt; C2.symm
    generates the file

-   Reference frames have axis pointing towards (0, 0, 0), translational
    dof along x-axis; recenter to ensure that anchor residues align with
    x-axis such that translating along the x-axis causes atomic contact
    between subunits

FAQ: <http://www.robetta.org/faqs.jsp>

Q. What are Fragment Libraries?

Fragment Libraries are the pieces of experimentally determined
structures that Rosetta uses to guide the search of conformational space
when predicting structures using the ab initio protocol, as well as
longer loop conformations in homology models.

Q. What is the difference between Ab Initio and De Novo Modeling?

Ab initio structure prediction classically refers to structure
prediction using nothing more than first-principles (i.e. physics). De
Novo is a more general term that refers to the greater category of
methods that do not use templates from homologous PDB structures. Since
Rosetta uses fragments from existing PDB structures in order to guide
the search in conjunction with energy functions, there is a semantic
argument as to whether it is truly "ab initio" (although the same could
be said for any statistically derived energy function). Long story
short: call it what you want, but be prepared for a debate!
